### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


A list of things Iâ€™ve done in the crypto and web3 space.

## Highlights

1.  Built a multi-chain NFT platform called [Arthouse](https://art.atila.ca/), for deploying NFTs to any EVM-compatible chain ([github](https://github.com/atilatech/arthouse), [made a tutorial about how I built it](https://atila.ca/blog/tomiwa/how-to-build-a-multi-chain-nft-marketplace-on-ethereum-polygon-and-binance-smart-chain-using-solidity-react-hardhat-and-ethersjs/), [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tomiwa1a/status/1531628638470230021))
    

    1.  Got it [personally reviewed by the original ERC-721 author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_wVSSXXGc8&t=1356s)
    

3.  [Added a feature](https://github.com/tallycash/extension/pull/1831) to Tally crypto wallet that allows crypto wallet extensions like Tally and Metamask to be connected to centralized exchanges
    
4.  Built a [smart contract library for implementing Harberger Taxes as NFTs](https://github.com/atilatech/smart)
    
5.
